## Why Instrata

Instrata helps users quickly document processes and workflows without manually capturing or organizing screenshots. It automatically captures relevant screenshots, allowing you to annotate, highlight, or blur content, and compile them into guides suitable for sharing, reporting, or internal documentation. This saves time and improves clarity when creating step-by-step instructions.

## Key Features

- Automatic screenshot capture for step-by-step guides
- Multi-format export: images, Markdown, HTML, PDF, JSON project files
- Simple image editing: blur, highlight, text, basic adjustments
- Hotkeys and system tray support
- Minimalist, modern UI
- Focused on ease-of-use and workflow efficiency
