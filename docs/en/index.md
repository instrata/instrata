Instrata helps you turn workflows into professional documentation.  
Capture your screen, annotate steps, and export ready-to-use guides without switching tools.

- ::pencil:: Edit with minimal clicks
- ::file-text:: Export to multiple shareable formats
- ::app-window:: Works offline and across platforms ::social/windows:: ::social/linux:: ::social/apple::

Start from the [::hand:: Introduction](./guide/introduction) to learn the basics or go straight to [::monitor-down:: Installation](./guide/installation) to set up the app.
